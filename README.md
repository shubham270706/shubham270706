# 🛡️ Shubham Mahato – Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! I'm **Shubham Mahato**, an aspiring **SOC Analyst** with a strong focus on Blue Team operations, log analysis, and threat detection. This repository is a living showcase of my practical projects, home lab environments, tools I've mastered, and real-world simulations I've implemented to sharpen my skills.

## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I’m building my cybersecurity career one log, alert, and packet at a time. My focus is on **defensive security**, working with real tools and real data. From simulating brute-force SSH attacks to creating custom Wazuh rules and forwarding alerts via **Discord** and **Email**, every project here reflects hands-on work—no fluff, just practical experience.

- 🔍 **Aspiring SOC Analyst** actively building a defensive home lab  
- 🧪 Comfortable on **Ubuntu**, **Kali Linux**, and **Windows** systems  
- 🛠️ Work extensively with **Wazuh**, **ELK Stack**, **Zeek**, and **Wireshark**  
- 🎯 Learning by doing — not just theory, but implementation and incident response

## 🔬 Featured Project: SOC Home Lab

🖥️ **[SOC Analyst Home Lab Project](https://github.com/shubham270706/SOC-Lab-Project)**  
A fully documented virtual SOC environment using:
- 🧱 **Wazuh + ELK Stack** for threat detection & dashboards  
- 🧑‍💻 **Ubuntu Agents** to simulate monitored endpoints  
- 💥 **Kali Linux Attacker VM** for SSH brute force and MITM tests  
- 📦 **Custom rule creation**, **FIM**, **Active Response**, and **Alert Forwarding**

Each folder in the repo documents a real configuration, issue, or test I performed.

## 📚 Learning Journey

- ✅ Completed **TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Pathway**
- 🚧 Currently learning **Bash scripting** for automation
- 🧠 Exploring advanced Wazuh use cases & active response tuning
- 🎯 Goal: Land a **Junior SOC Analyst** role in a Blue Team environment

## 📁 Other Projects

- **Malware Analysis** – Basic static and behavioral analysis via TryHackMe  
- **Digital Forensics Practice** – Simulated disk and memory analysis tasks  
- **Log Review Challenges** – Investigated Windows and Linux log trails

---

## 📚 Certifications & Learning

While I haven’t earned formal certifications yet, I’ve completed **practical, hands-on learning paths** on platforms like:

- ✅ **TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Pathway** – focused on log analysis, threat detection, and SOC workflows  
- 🛠️ **Google IT Support (In Progress)** – for foundational knowledge of IT systems  
- 💡 Exploring content on **HackTheBox**, **OverTheWire**, and other CTF platforms to sharpen technical skills

I'm focused on real-world skills first — building and defending systems in my own lab, documenting the journey as I go.  
**Certification is a goal, but hands-on capability is my current strength.**
